PROJECT PLAN FOR 3D-MAP OF INFERNO

Data: Dante's Inferno -- Original Italian Text & Hollander Translation from Princeton Dante Project
Data Structures: JSON Object of Poem divided by marked by location and memetic typologies [see Data Work](https://github.com/jthirkield/thesis/blob/master/work/DataStructures.txt)
Total Number of lines: 4420 lines / estimated 1000 objects


Frontend platform and libraries: webgl, Threejs libraries

Backend platform: Mongodb database server

Overall Functionality goals for May 17: A 3D-movable, scalable and interactive map of the Inferno with proper geometric proportions relative to the text. The map should navigate through the text via map locations and populations: including souls, demons, Dante & Virgil, architectural elements, and thresholds. If time allows, the inverse should work too: scrolling through the text navigates through the map. 

April 21: working frontend in threejs with rollovers by dot (souls/demons) and level (circle of hell). Thesis treatment part 1 complete

April 28: enhanced frontend with linked text and scrolling on one circle of hell, using json objects. Thesis treatment part 2 complete

May 5: complete and integrate full mongo database with front end. All database research and categorization of typologies should be finalized and completed at this point.

May 12: bug testing and enhancements. Full interaction across the poem by groupings. Thesis treatment part 3 complete.

May 17: final enhancements and bug fixes.
