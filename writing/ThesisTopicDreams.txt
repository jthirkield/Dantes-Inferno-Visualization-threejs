Sleep/Dream
Research Question
I am visualizing clinical studies of the brain/language of dreaming because I want to show how computer graphics can represent/express text in order to better represent internal (brain) and linguistic (text reports)

Thesis Statement
The brain as a black box vs the computer as a black box, how can a computer mirror the activity of meaning creation while questioning its own production of visual language...
