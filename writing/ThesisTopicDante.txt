Topic: Dante's Divine Comedy
Research Question
I am visualizing Dante's Divine Comedy because I want to show how visualization and text interact in order to see how GUI platforms can expand subjective/collective engagement with text worlds.

Subjective Reading as Visualization
		Once the Map (Foundational Visualization) is established a variety of interpretive components can be added based on the mapped or text-based location.
			Notes/Translations
			Figures: Image/Sketches/Motion
			Responses/Personal Info
			Highlighting the Subjectivity of my interpretation
		SOCIAL ASPECT
			Built to allow for other "readings"
			No hierarchy of readings, just expanding nodes of interpretation
			Sharing of subjective experience/Building of complex collective subjectivities
			sharing of images
			Built to allow for other to add new components to the world

Machine Reading
	create a pattern searching algorithm that reads both the original Italian / the english translation(s)/other translations (as add) / as well as the readings

MAP Foundational Visualization
	INTERACTIVE map of the terrian
		Hell
			Downward Spirial
			Always goes left?
			Darker/Colder
			City of Dis
			Circles
		Purgatory
			Upward Spiral (Mountain)
			Always goes right?
			9 levles
			Ends on Garden
		Paradise
			Celestial Bodies
			Moon/Mercury/
			Ethereal Spirits
			Rose
	Time Lapse
		7 Days?
		Time Told Via Celestial Positions
		Medieval Planetary Model
	Geographical Position
		Italy -- Jerusalem -- Moon -- Ether -- etc
		Medieval Geography

Audience
	readers
	poets/writers
	translators
	people who are alive
	people who are dead
	academic (only later)
		This will be not built for academics to quibble over meanings, although it will be open to criticism from academics

Thesis Questions
	What is a "reading" in the context of GUI
	How is reading/visualization an expressive act
	How we do maintain/lose the primacy of text as the basis for complex meaning creation
		the primacy of text as the basis of shared experience
		Story/Poetic Structure as foundation for imaginative expansion
	How can a virtual/metaphysical world be built from a source text
		That to Dante the text was more "real" than the world
	How do we make images from text in the act of reading
		How does that differ from a computer's facility for image making
		Text to world theory
		phantasm and metalanguage
	How is this act form of transaltion
		Source text in Italian: machine will read that part
		Text to Visual is a translation
