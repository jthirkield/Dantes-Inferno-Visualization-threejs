#STORY MAP    

###Introduction
###Treatment
##1. Dante's topology
####1.1. Inferno/Purgatory/Paradise

  -Shape/Topology of Dante's Universe: Why visualize Dante? Because it is such a rich universe, and you will learn its general topology so that we follow Dante's journey... 
	
  -Dante's Journey/how he creates the landscape: Dante is especially detailed about his universe, he wants you to imagine it, he is very very specific, and even provides ways of measuring giants and the devil. What else does he measure?
  
  -Other measures: He tells you where he is in time, Easter week 1300, he tells you where he is in relationship to Earth's geography and the constellations, and what time of day it is. Then, in Paradise, he tells you what planet he is on.

  -Aristotilian Ptomelic Universe: Where did Dante get his model of the universe, from Aristole and Ptolemy, it's important that we understand that because it is different from us and it does date things a bit.
  
####1.2. Historical Interpretations

   -Botticelli/Galileo/Ruskin/Matthews: Why am I reconstructing Dante? Despite its datedness, many others through history have one way or another. Here are some key examples. But really, why another Dante reconstruction today?

   -Contemporary context of Dante: Dante haunts our imagination, often in spooky/inaccurate ways, because culture has its notions of Dante that have strayed far from the text (Nietsche was a jerk about it, Pirate of the Caribbean/Dan Brown reference it for weak reasons).

   -How distant is the Divine Comedy from our culture: How distant is the Christian/Ptolematic universe, theological/poetic allegory from us. Very, but he is building a metaphysical world, which is something everyone does now.
   
####1.3. Why Interface and Dante
	
   -Geometric synergy: The power of Dante is the geometric basis of his world, the interface is biased toward simple geometric shapes.

   -Spatial thinking: Reading a text like Dante's requires complex geometric thinking, the interface may help aid/enhance that space

   -Renewing Reading: maybe you want to understand the poem on a deeper level, I would like to find a way to help you do that, maybe there is a way of reading spatially...

##2. Reading as Visualization
####2.1. Borges reading of Dante: Why Borges? Because he is a bridge between Dante and us, and because he is an epistemological bridge between literature and the internet.

   -Borges is my Virgil: Borges is a spatial reader, he guides my methods of reading so that I'm not just making this up as I go along.
   
   -Coleridge's Flower: Do you want to dream about a flower and then wake up with it in your hand?
   
####2.2. The Spatial Imagination

   -Elaine Scarry (and others): Well, you can, sort of, because text includes many cognitive tricks what allow the brain to visualize that flower, and if you read Elaine Scarry's work you will know how that works.
   
####2.3. Expressive Reading

   -how is reading/visualization an expressive act: once you have dreamed that flower and you wake up and its not in your hand, then maybe you should make yourself...

   -story/poetic structure as foundation: the advantage of creating a visual interface is that it will allow you to create and then attach that flower to the part of the book that directed you to create it in the first place...

##3. Visualization as Reading
####3.1. GUI's transformation of the reading experience: do you think the GUI is a terrible place for reading? I agree.

   -Graphesis/Hayles/McGann / Imagining Language: These people think it's more complicated than that and they have some cool ideas about how to deal with the GUI as reading space, lets discuss their approaches and see if they are helpful...

####3.2. Previous examples of Visualizations of proir text

   -Making of the Americas/Talmud/Ben Fry: Have you wondered who else has tried to harness the GUI for new ways of reading, here are some good ones. My work draws from them.

####3.3 Spatial Networks/Expressive Reading: If all readings of texts entail some form of subjective/interior image creation, and all creations of GUI reading interfaces are subjective interpretive acts how can that be foregrounded? By expressive reading... 

   3.3.1 Notes/Translations: But what is that? Well it's reading deeply and re-interpreting that reading through a medium (like with Borges Essays, or a 3-D printed version of the flower you imagined in your brain). 

   -What do you think would be a good way to read expressively? Here are some suggestions: perhaps create an Image/Sketch/Video/Essay/Poem/Story/Piece of code highlighting the new subjective knowledge/understand/vision your reading has produced.
   
   3.3.2. SOCIAL ASPECT: But for whom? Why express if not to others? This a both a space for new kind of readings and containing those readings/subjective traces

   -How will those readings be contained? There will be no hierarchy of readings, just expanding nodes of interpretation/art works/traces: Sharing of subjective experience/Building of complex collective subjectivities. This could be built to allow for others to add new components to the world
   
   3.3.3 Who will be involved/who are the audiences: all kinds of readers, there will be different ways in which this project appeals to poets, writers, scholars, visual artists, coders, machines..

   3.4.3 Machines? Yes, there may be a machine reading component down the road that will do its own expressive readings...
