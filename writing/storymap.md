###Introduction
###Treatment
##1. Dante's topology
1.1. Inferno/Purgatory/Paradise

  -Shape of Topology of Dante's Universe: Why visualize Dante? Because it is such a rich universe, and you will learn its general topology so that we can go through Dante's journey... 
	
  -Dante's Journey/how he creates the landscape: Dante is especially detailed about his universe, he wants you to imagine it, he is very very specific, and even provides ways of measuring giants and the devil. What else does he measure?
	-Other measures: He tell you where he is in time Easter week (1300), he tells you where he is in relationship to earth's geography and the constellations, and he what time of day it is. Then, in Paradise, he tell you what planet he is on.
	-Aristotilian Ptomelic Universe: Where did Dante get his model of the universe, from Aristole and Ptomely...
	1.2. Historical Interpretations
	-Botticelli/Galileo/Ruskin/Matthews: Why am I reconstructing Dante? Because everyone else has in one way or another. Here are some key examples. But really, why another Dante reconstruction today?
	-Contemporary context of Dante: Dante haunts our imagination, often in spooky/inaccurate ways, because culture has its notions of Dante that have strayed far from the text (Nietsche was a jerk about it, Pirate of the Caribbean and Dan Brown reference it).
	-How the Divine Comedy is distant from our culture: His Christian/Ptolematic universe, theological/poetic allegory--he is building a metaphysical world
	1.3. Why Interface and Dante
	-Geometric synergy: The power of Dante is the geometric basis of his world, the interface is geometrically tuned
	-Spatial thinking: Reading a text like Dante's requires complex geometric thinking, the interface can aid/enhance that space
	-Renewing Reading: maybe you want to understand the poem on a deeper level, I would like to find a way to help you do that, maybe there is a way of reading spatially...
</ul>
##2. Reading as Visualization
	2.1. Borges reading of Dante: Why Borges? Because he is a bridge between Dante and us, and because he is an epistemological bridge between literature and the internet.
	-Borges is my Virgil: Borges is a spatial reader, he guides my methods of reading so that I'm not just making this up as I go along.
	-Coleridge's Flower: Do you want to dream about a flower and then wake up with it in your hand?
	2.2. The Spatial Imagination
	-Elaine Scarry (and others): We you can, sort of, because text includes many cognitive tricks what allow the brain to visualize that flower, and if you read Elaine Scarry's work you will know how that works
	2.3. Expressive Reading
	how is reading/visualization an expressive act: once you have dreamed that flower and you wake up and its not in your hand, then maybe you should make yourself
    story/poetic structure as foundation: the advantage of creating a visual interface as that it will allow you to create and then attach that flower to the part of the book that directed you to create it in the first place
##3. Visualization as Reading
	3.1. GUI as transformation of the reading experience: do you think the GUI is a terrible place for reading, I agree.
	-Graphesis/Hayles/McGann / Imagining Language: These people think it's more complicated and they have some cool ideas about how to deal with the GUI as reading space, lets discuss their approaches and see if they are helpful
	3.2. Previous examples of Visualizations of proir text
	-Making of the Americas/Talmud/Ben Fry: Have you wondered who else has tried to harness the GUI for new ways of reading, here are some good ones. My way draws from them.
	3.3 Spatial Networks/Expressive Reading: If all readings of texts entail some form of subjective/interior image creation, and all creations of GUI reading interfaces are subjective interpretive acts how can that be foregrounded? By expressive reading 
	3.3.1 Notes/Translations: But what is that? Well it's reading deeply and re-interpreting that reading through another medium (like with Borges Essays, or a 3-D print version of the flower that was in your brain). 
	-What do you think would be a good way to read expressively? Here are some suggestions: perhaps create an Image/Sketch/Video/Essay/Poem/Story/Piece of code  highlighting the new subject knowledge your reading has projects of my interpretation.
	3.3.2. SOCIAL ASPECT: But for whom? Why express if not to others. This a both a space for new kind of readings and containing those readings/subjective traces
	-How will those readings be contained: There will be no hierarchy of readings, just expanding nodes of interpretation/art works/traces: Sharing of subjective experience/Building of complex collective subjectivities, Built to allow for other to add new components to the world
	3.3.3 Who will be involved: all kinds of readers, there will be different ways for this project to appeal to poets, writers, scholars, visual artists, coders, machines..
	3.4.3 Machines? Yes, there will be a machine reading component down the road that will do its own expressive readings...
